# Let's Get Started

Vue Vixens is an initiative created by Jen Looper, a Senior Developer Advocate at [Progress](http://www.progress.com), creators of NativeScript, Kendo UI, Open Edge, and more. Vue Vixens' mission is to create workshops to teach Vue.js in a cool and fun way to 'foxy people who identify as women'. It is based on the successful model pioneered by Shmuela Jacobs for the Angular community, [http://www.ng-girls.org](ng-girls.org). Ng-Girls was in turn inspired by the Rails Bridge and Django Girls initiatives.

::: tip Not just workshops!
We do more than full day workshops! We also can help with your conference's diversity offerings - just contact us at [info@vuevixens.org](mailto:info@vuevixens.org).
:::

These workshops are designed to help people get better acquainted with both Vue.js and NativeScript-Vue, an implementation of Vue.js that lets developers write native mobile apps using Vue. 3/4 of a standard workshop day is spent on the web, and 1/4 on mobile. Below is an interview with Jen and Evan You, creator of Vue, and Igor Randjelovic, creator of NativeScript-Vue, giving the background and history of the projects.

These documents are presented in two groups. The first grouping of chapters comprises the full-day workshop. The second grouping are listed as 'mini-workshops' and can be done ad hoc with groups for breakfasts, lunch and learns, or meetups. We are adding to this content progressively. 

All the online codelabs are designed to be completed in groups in a self-study mode in a workshop format during meetups, conferences, and brown-bag lunches. For the all-day workshops, it is best to break up the day into parts and regroup users periodically so that 'no developer is left behind'. If an attendee gets lost, she can 'reboot' by downloading the ending point for each previous chapter into a new code sandbox. Workshop attendees and mentors can to register for events at [http://www.vuevixens.org](vuevixens.org). Vue Vixens workshops are free, but depend on budget from conferences and meetups to provide lunch, breakfast, or snacks, and a space with wifi.

The goal of the program is to familiarize women and those who identify as such with concepts of programming for web and mobile using Vue.js in a supportive and inclusive environment. Join a skulk near you!

## Workshop Content


- Part 1 – The Pet shop’s UI – turn on the lights!
  - Using CSS and variables, enable a switch on a web page that will turn on your shop’s lights (e.g. switch the page’s theme). Very basic introduction to our project’s code structure
- Part 2 – Pets for sale! – build a card interface
  - Using static data, create an interface to display the pet by image and name
- Part 3 – Good dogs – connect to an API
  - Swap out your static interface with a connection to the Dog CEO API: [https://dog.ceo/dog-api/](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)
- Part 4 – Adopt a dog – create a shopping experience
  - Create a shopping cart for the shop so that you can add and remove a dog from your cart
 
> A note about the cart - it's always better to adopt a pet, rather than buy one, if you can! This is just a demo e-commerce type of app.

- Part 5 – Check this out – complete the cart with a checkout form
  - Learn how to build a form to accept dummy checkout data so you can complete your dog’s adoption
- Part 6 – Mobilize me – craft a social NativeScript app for your pet
  - Now that you’ve adopted a dog, display his/her stats in a mobile app and use the Social Share plugin to tell your friends about him/her. This app will be built in the NativeScript Playground
