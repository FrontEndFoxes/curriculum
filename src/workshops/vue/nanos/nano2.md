# Create a random cat picture viewer

You will be creating a simple Vue app that will make HTTP calls through [**Axios**](https://github.com/axios/axios) to a remote _API_ to get cat images.

::: tip üí°
API means _Application Programming Interface_. In **very** simple terms, it's a bunch of URLs to which we can make requests to either get or send data.
:::

## Get Started

Head over to [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) and [create a new **Vue** template](https://codesandbox.io/s/vue).

The sandbox will set up a new Vue application where we can write our code, and it will be automatically compiled and rendered in the window on the right.

## Preliminary Code Clean Up

Go to `App.vue` and remove everything from inside the `div` with the id `#app` and clear the `<script>` tag. In the end, your file should look like this:

```js
<template>
  <div id="app">

  </div>
</template>

<script>

export default {
  name: "App",
};
</script>
```

The reason you're doing this is so that you have a clean slate without all the boilerplate stuff Codesandbox adds.

## Adding Axios to the project

Now you need to add **Axios** to the project!

Head over to the left side menu bar and click the `Dependencies` tab. Once it has expanded, click the `Add Dependency` button and search for `axios`. Click on it once you find it on the list and _voil√†_, it's added to your project dependencies.

::: tip üí°
Are you following this nano on a local development enviroment outside the Codesandbox environment? Install `axios` by running `npm install axios` or `yarn add axios` on your terminal on the project root.
:::

## Importing the Axios library

Before you can start making all the _cat-tastic_ HTTP calls, you need to add the `axios` library to your component.

::: tip üí°
Just adding a dependency to the project doesn't automatically _include_ it to your components. In Vue, you need to manually import the dependencies you are going to use.
:::

Head to `App.vue` again and add this `import statement` directly below the opening `<script>` tag:

```js
import axios from 'axios';
```

Now you can use `axios` on your component.

## Create the API call

It's time to prepare a function to call the Cat API.

Go inside the `export default { }` block and add a new method:

```js
export default {
	name: 'App',
	methods: {
		fetchNewCat() {
			axios
				.get('https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search')
				.then(response => {
					console.log('Search complete!');
					console.log(response);
				})
				.catch(err => {
					console.log('Search failed!');
					console.log(err);
				});
		},
	},
};
```

This may be overwhelming to see for the first time, so let's break it down in digestible pieces.

First, you are declaring a new method `fetchNewCat` that will take no parameters `()`.

Inside this method, you start our `axios` call by calling `.get`:

```js
axios.get('https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search');
```

`Axios` works with the so-called [_HTTP Verbs or HTTP Methods_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods). Here you are making a _GET_ type call to the **https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search** URL.

The most "common" ones are:

-   GET - To GET information _from_ an HTTP URL
-   POST - To POST information _to_ an HTTP URL

::: tip üí°
_Which method should I use?_ It depends! Working with APIs involves usually interacting with its creator or diving into the documentation. `GET` and `POST` are used 99% of the time, but some APIs (REST APIs in particular) may use a lot more.
:::

Axios returns a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise), which is a JavaScript object that holds the response from an _asynchronous_ HTTP call.

If this call succeeds, then the code inside the `then` block is executed. If there is a problem, then the code inside the `catch` block is executed.

In both cases you're just going to print the results to the console for now.

Let's quickly add a button to our app so you can call this API ad hoc.

Add this markup to your `<template>`:

```js
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <button @click="fetchNewCat">New Cat</button>
  </div>
</template>
```

Go ahead and click on the button on the right hand screen and open up the **Console** tab on the very bottom of your screen.

You will see an output that is very similar to this:

![consoleoutput](./images/axios-consoleoutput.png)

This is logging the `response` parameter in our `then` block. You are getting back a JS _Object_ with a bunch of data about the HTTP call you just made, like the `status` and `headers`.

Inside this object you also get a `data` array which holds the actual response that the API returned. In this case, it's another _Object_ that holds the information for your cat picture.

**Congratulations!** That's all it take to make a simple API call using Axios!

## Using the Data

This app is kind of basic right now if you don't do anything with the data, so let's put it to good use. Let's store the `URL` of the cat image inside a property in our app so we can put it on the screen.

Go into the `export default {}` block again, and add a `catImage` property, and let's store the `URL` in our `then` block.

```js
<script>
import axios from "axios";

export default {
  name: "App",
  data() {
    return {
      // Were storing the cat image url in this prop
      catImage: null
    };
  },
  methods: {
    fetchNewCat() {
      axios
        .get("https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search")
        .then(response => {
          console.log("Search complete!");
          console.log(response);

          // Add the cat image url to our app property
          this.catImage = response.data[0].url;
        })
        .catch(err => {
          console.log("Search failed!");
          console.log(err);
        });
    }
  }
};
</script>
```

Finally, let's create an image on our markup to show our result:

```html
<template>
	<div id="app"><button @click="fetchNewCat">New Cat</button> <img :src="catImage" alt="Cat Image" /></div>
</template>
```

Now click the "New Cat" button and behold! (PS. You can click again for new images!)

The entire code of your `App.vue` file should look like this:

```js
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <button @click="fetchNewCat">New Cat</button> <img :src="catImage" alt="" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import axios from "axios";

export default {
  name: "App",
  data() {
    return {
      catImage: null
    };
  },
  methods: {
    fetchNewCat() {
      axios
        .get("https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search")
        .then(response => {
          console.log("Search complete!");
          console.log(response);

          this.catImage = response.data[0].url;
        })
        .catch(err => {
          console.log("Search failed!");
          console.log(err);
        });
    }
  }
};
</script>
```

## Conclusion and Challenge

Making HTTP calls adds dynamic functionality to your app and is a core functionality to learn for any front-end developer.

Your challenge, if you're feeling **bold**, is to go to https://docs.thecatapi.com/api-reference and see if you can implement a more complex GET call passing parameters, or even make a POST call to upload your own cat image!

PS. You will need the `axios` documentation on hand. https://github.com/axios/axios
