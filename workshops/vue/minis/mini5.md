# Instructions

## Read over these instructions

Get an idea of where we're headed!

## Get started as a Spotify Developer

Read over the Web Playback SDK Quick Start guide and obtain an **Access Token**:

[Spotify Web Playback SDK Quick Start](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/quick-start/)

::: tip üí°
Your access token expires after **one hour**, so you will need to re-request a token every hour! If your app suddenly stops working, try refreshing your token first.
:::

## Pick and commit to your feature requirements for a minimum viable product (MVP)

Ideas include:

-   [ ] Ability to play song
-   [ ] Ability to pause song
-   [ ] Ability to seek previous track
-   [ ] Ability to seek next track
-   [ ] See the name of a song
-   [ ] Disable buttons if player is offline
-   [ ] Alert the user if the player is offline
-   [ ] Make the UI fully accessible

## Open the Codesandbox template

[DJ Vixen Spotify Player starter kit](https://codesandbox.io/s/dj-vixen-cm00g)

## Augment basic UI

In this Code Sandbox, you're provided with a basic UI that isn't quite done. Some people prefer to start with the UI layer and hook up the data after. Others prefer to fix the UI after the behind-the-scenes is done. The choice is yours! Here, we suggest starting with the UI so you can test for functionality as you go.

::: tip üí°
Be sure to "time box" this step - it is tempting to spend a long time perfecting the styling, but try to limit yourself to 15 minutes if you can. You can always come back later!

## Create the data layer

This is the hard part, fam!

-   First, read the **Web Playback SDK Quick Start** and **SDK Reference** if you haven't already. These can be found at the bottom of this page in the **Resources** section. (Don't worry, they are pretty short!)

::: tip üí°
In order for the player to play music, you'll need to open "real" Spotify (in an app or web browser, doesn't matter) and **change the device to DJ Vixen** once you've successfully connected the player.
:::

-   Work together to fill in the missing functions!

## Add UI finishing touches!

## Challenge

Just kidding. Pat yourself on the back; this was a challenging enough day! üèÜ

Okay, **still looking for more?** Try moving from the Web Playback SDK to the ü•Å full-fledged [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/). Looking for side project or code sample ideas? This is a great API to use!
