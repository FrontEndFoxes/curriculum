## What You'll Build

![sketchnote](./images/Ch4.png)

## Instructions

If you need to restart your project, clone [this repo](https://github.com/FrontEndFoxes/projects/tree/main/chapter-3-end) into Code Sandbox by clicking on the **Import from GitHub** link on the bottom left of the main page, and then pasting the repo's url into the fields. You can also continue with the project you've created in [chapter 3](ch3.md).

In this chapter, we will build a 'loyalty list' - like a shopping cart but for adoptions - to show the list of dogs that we particularly like and would like to adopt. To get started, create a new, blank file in the `views` folder and name it `Favorites.vue`.

## Build the Loyalty List

The first thing we need in this new component is a template. Inside this new file add a `<template></template>` tags.

Inside `template` tags create a `<div></div>` tag and add a simple text 'My Favorites'.

```html
<template>
	<div>
		My Favorites
	</div>
</template>
```

Now let's connect our newly created component with the router and check if it's displaying correctly on its corresponding route.

Go to the `main.js` file. On the top, after importing `Home` and `Pets` components, add one more import statement:

```js
import Favorites from './views/Favorites';
```

After that, add one more route to the `routes`:

```js
{ path: "/favorites", component: Favorites }
```

In the browser address bar try to navigate to `/favorites` (simply add `/favorites` to the URL of the homepage). You should see the text 'My Favorites' between the header and the footer.

Let's add a link to our list inside the navbar. Later we will also show the selected items amount on it, but for now it will be just a plain icon with link. Go to the `App.vue` file and add the following code inside `v-toolbar` right after the closing tag of `v-toolbar-items`:

```html
<v-spacer></v-spacer>
<router-link to="/favorites">
	<v-icon large>loyalty</v-icon>
</router-link>
```

::: tip ðŸ’¡
`v-spacer` is a Vuetify component to fill the whole free space between other components. `v-icon` is a component displaying [Material icons](https://material.io/icons/).
:::

Now when you're clicking on the favorites icon you will be navigated to `/favorites` route.

Let's create markup for the `Favorites` component. We will use Vuetify's list component to display our dogs. Let's remove our placeholder text from the `<div></div>` tag and replace it with `<v-list></v-list` tag. Now the template looks like this:

```html
<div>
	<v-list> </v-list>
</div>
```

We need a name for this list. Vuetify is using a `v-subheader` component for this purpose, so let's add one:

```html
<div>
	<v-list>
		<v-subheader>My Favorites</v-subheader>
	</v-list>
</div>
```

Now let's add a list element with mock data: a dog image, its name and a delete icon. We will need a `v-list-item` component for the list item; `v-list-item-avatar` for the dog image; `v-list-item-content` for its name and `v-list-item-action` plus `v-icon` for the delete button.

::: tip ðŸ’¡
Learn more about lists in the [Vuetify list component docs](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/lists).
:::

Now our template is:

```html
<div>
	<v-list>
		<v-subheader>My Favorites</v-subheader>
		<v-list-item @click="{}">
			<v-list-item-avatar>
				<img src="https://images.dog.ceo/breeds/husky/n02110185_7888.jpg" />
			</v-list-item-avatar>
			<v-list-item-content>Fluffy</v-list-item-content>
			<v-list-item-action>
				<v-icon>delete</v-icon>
			</v-list-item-action>
		</v-list-item>
	</v-list>
</div>
```

## Manage the List's State with Vuex

At this point, you can see the UI coming together. Now it's time to display some real data inside the list, but now we have a problem: how can we save selected dogs and pass them from the `Pets` component to the `Favorites` one? We cannot use props, because these two components don't have any 'parent-child' relationship... In such cases we need a _state management_ library and Vue does have one: it's called `Vuex`.

::: tip ðŸ’¡
Vuex is a state management pattern and library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion. It allows you to keep data that can be shared with the components in your application. Learn more [here](http://vuex.vuejs.org/en/).
:::

To start working with this centralized store we have to add Vuex to our application. First, scroll down in the `Explorer` tab and open the `Dependencies` dropdown. Click on `Add dependency` button and seach for `vuex`. Install the dependency. Vuex will be added to your `package.json`.

Now let's create a `store` folder inside `/src`. Add a `store.js` file inside of this new folder. This is where we will save all the application's data.

Open the `store.js` and import Vuex:

```js
import Vue from 'vue';
import Vuex from 'vuex';

Vue.use(Vuex);
```

Now let's create and export the actual store:

```js
export default new Vuex.Store({});
```

What actually do we want to save on our application state? It's a list of favorites, which will contain selected dogs. Let's add a `favorites` array to our initial `state` object by adding it between the curly brackets:

```js
export default new Vuex.Store({
	state: {
		favorites: [],
	},
});
```

We then have to add this store to our Vue instance. To do this, move to the `main.js` file and import it under the rest of the imports:

```js
import store from './store/store';
```

Then add the `store` to the Vue instance properties in `main.js`:

```js
new Vue({
	router,
	store,
	vuetify,
	render: (h) => h(App),
}).$mount('#app');
```

Now all the components in the application will have access to our state via `this.$store.state` placed inside any component's computed property. Let's try to access it from the `Favorites` component.

::: tip ðŸ’¡
Computed properties can be used to do quick calculations of properties that are displayed in the view. These calculations will be cached and will only update when their dependencies are changed.
:::

Inside `Favorites.vue` add the `<script>` block under the `<template>` block with the `export default` statement:

```js
<script>export default {};</script>
```

...and add the `computed` property to the component by editing the `<script>` block:

```js
<script>
  export default {
    computed: {
      favorites() {
        return this.$store.state.favorites;
      }
    }
  };
</script>
```

You can see that `favorites()` is a function which will return the value of the `favorites` array stored in state so we can use it in our component.

## Populate Favorites

Let's replace our mock data with the `favorites` content.

First let's temporarily add some content to the `state.favorites`. Copy the first three dogs from the `data/dogs.js` file and paste them to the `favorites` array in `store.js`:

```js
state: {
  favorites: [
    {
      name: "Max",
      breed: "husky",
      img: "https://images.dog.ceo/breeds/husky/n02110185_1469.jpg"
    },
    {
      name: "Rusty",
      breed: "shiba",
      img: "https://images.dog.ceo/breeds/shiba/shiba-13.jpg"
    },
    {
      name: "Rocco",
      breed: "boxer",
      img: "https://images.dog.ceo/breeds/boxer/n02108089_14112.jpg"
    },
  ]
},
```

Inside the `Favorites.vue` component we will iterate through the `favorites` array with the now-familiar `v-for` directive. Change the `<template>` `<div>` to this markup:

```html
<div>
	<v-list>
		<v-subheader>My Favorites</v-subheader>
		<v-list-item v-for="(dog, index) in favorites" :key="index" @click="{}">
			<v-list-item-avatar>
				<img :src="dog.img" />
			</v-list-item-avatar>
			<v-list-item-content>{{dog.name}}</v-list-item-content>
			<v-list-item-action>
				<v-icon>delete</v-icon>
			</v-list-item-action>
		</v-list-item>
	</v-list>
</div>
```

::: tip ðŸ’¡
What changed? Notice that the `src` attribute changed to `:src`, because now we are using a dynamic property for it. We have also made sure the name is dynamic by changing `Fluffy` to `dog.name` in curly braces.
:::

::: tip ðŸ’¡
Note that we have also added `:key` next to our `v-for` in the `v-list-item` opening tag. We did this because Vue wants us to provide a key when using `v-for`. By using `(dog, index) in favorites` in our `v-for`, we also get the index of the array per dog. For Max we get index 0, for Rusty we get index 1 and so on. We can then use this as our key. More background information can be found [here](https://vuejs.org/guide/list.html#Maintaining-State).
:::

Now we can see our mock data displaying on the `/favorites` route! Let's add some more UI tweaks to make the page look better.

## UI Tweaks

First, we need to add a placeholder to show when our list is empty.

::: tip ðŸ’¡
Note: the `v-if` directive conditionally renders the element based on the "truthiness" of the expression value - whether it is true or false. `v-else` directive serves as an 'else' block for `v-if`, providing an 'else' condition.
:::

We will wrap the whole list content in the wrapper div and show it only when we have items in our list of favorites; otherwise the user will see the placeholder text. Let's change the template:

```html
<template>
	<v-list>
		<v-subheader v-if="!favorites.length">Your favorites list is empty</v-subheader>
		<div v-else>
			<v-subheader>Your favorites</v-subheader>
			<v-list-item v-for="(dog, index) in favorites" :key="index" @click="{}">
				<v-list-item-avatar>
					<img :src="dog.img" />
				</v-list-item-avatar>
				<v-list-item-content>{{dog.name}}</v-list-item-content>
				<v-list-item-action>
					<v-icon>delete</v-icon>
				</v-list-item-action>
			</v-list-item>
		</div>
	</v-list>
</template>
```

::: tip ðŸ’¡
What is happening here? First, the application will check if the `favorites` array has a _length_ (i.e. if there are some items inside this array; an empty array has a length equal to 0). If the length is 0, the application will display `Your favorites list is empty` text and will ignore the `v-else` block. If the array is not empty, the application will jump to the `v-else` block and render it.
:::

Let's also display the number of selected dogs above the tag icon in the toolbar. Move to the `App.vue` and add a computed property for `favorites` (similar to the `Favorites` component one we added earlier). You can place this under the `name` property:

```js
computed: {
  favorites() {
    return this.$store.state.favorites;
  }
},
```

Now let's wrap our favorites icon with the Vuetify `v-badge` component and show the number of items inside of it. Edit `App.vue` where we change the `<router-link>` block that we have for our favorites with the following markup:

```html
<router-link to="/favorites">
	<v-badge color="grey lighten-1" overlap right v-model="favorites.length">
		<span slot="badge">{{favorites.length}}</span>
		<v-icon large>loyalty</v-icon>
	</v-badge>
</router-link>
```

::: tip ðŸ’¡
The `v-model` directive here will define the visibility of the badge. So, if the list is empty, the badge will be hidden. Since there are three items in our mock data, we can see the number `3` inside the badge. This is behavior that is defined in the Vuetify badge component for which the documentation can be found [here](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/badges).
:::

## Add and Remove Dogs

We also need to build a way to add dogs to this favorites list and, sadly, to remove them from it. In other words, we have to _change our state_. The only way to actually change state in a Vuex store is by committing a _mutation_. Vuex mutations are very similar to events: each mutation has a string **type** and a **handler**. The type should denote what the mutation does, you can choose the name. Since we are creating a mutation to add dogs to our favorites, we choose `addToFavorites`. The handler function is where we perform actual state modifications and it will receive the state as the first argument. Let's create our first mutation. Inside the `store.js` clear the state `favorites` array and after the `state` property, add `mutations`:

```js
export default new Vuex.Store({
	state: {
		favorites: [],
	},
	mutations: {},
});
```

Inside this object create the `addToFavorites` mutation:

```js
export default new Vuex.Store({
	state: {
		favorites: [],
	},
	mutations: {
		addToFavorites(state, payload) {
			state.favorites.push(payload);
		},
	},
});
```

This mutation has two parameters: first is the `state` as said above; the second is the `data` or `payload` which we will add to our `state.favorites`. The `addToFavorites` mutation will add the payload item to the `state.favorites` array.

::: tip ðŸ’¡
You cannot directly call a mutation handler. To invoke it, you need to call store.commit with its type: `store.commit('addToFavorites')` and as you will see we will also have to add the payload.
:::

::: tip ðŸ’¡
Usually in Vuex mutations are committed with _actions_. Actions are similar to mutations but they can contain asynchronous operations (like API calls).
:::

Let's register an action to commit our `addToFavorites` mutation. Add the `actions` property to the store object and `addToFavorites` action to this property:

```js
export default new Vuex.Store({
	state: {
		favorites: [],
	},
	mutations: {
		addToFavorites(state, payload) {
			state.favorites.push(payload);
		},
	},
	actions: {
		addToFavorites({ commit }, payload) {
			commit('addToFavorites', payload);
		},
	},
});
```

::: tip ðŸ’¡
Action handlers receive a context object which exposes the same set of methods/properties on the store instance, so you can call `context.commit` to commit a mutation. We are using ES6 [argument destructuring](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#destructuring) to use the `commit` method of `context`, that's why we don't have `context` as our first argument but `{ commit }` as our first argument. If we would have `context` as a first argument, we should call `context.commit(...)` instead of directly calling `commit(...)`.
:::

::: tip ðŸ’¡
`payload` here is the same data we want to pass from the component to the mutation to change the state.
:::

## Build the UI

Let's call our action from inside the `Pets.vue` component. First we need some kind of a button to add a certain dog to the favorites list. Move to the `Dog.vue` component and add the button right below the `v-card-title` closing tag but still within the `v-card` tag:

```html
<v-btn @click="$emit('addToFavorites', dog)">Add to Favorites</v-btn>
```

By using `$emit`, we are sending the message to our parent component (in this case it's `Pets.vue`) like 'Hi, something is happening here! Please read this message and react to it'.

Our message also contains a second parameter: it's the `dog` which we're trying to add to our favorites list.

::: tip ðŸ’¡
So by calling `$emit('addToFavorites', dog)` we are sending an event with type `addToFavorites` and with data the dog that users want to add to the favorites. We have basically created a custom event for which more information can be found [here](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-custom-events.html).
:::

Now let's open `Pets.vue` and add a _listener_ to our emitted event `addToFavorites` by overwriting the current `<app-dog>` tag with this snippet:

```html
<app-dog :dog="pet" @addToFavorites=""></app-dog>
```

For now this listener is doing nothing but we want to call an action on this event. To do so we have to map the actions to our component.

::: tip ðŸ’¡
You can dispatch actions in components with `this.$store.dispatch('xxx')`, or use the `mapActions` helper which maps component methods to store.dispatch calls.
:::

We will use the second solution. First import the `mapActions` helper in `Pets.vue`:

```js
import { mapActions } from 'vuex';
```

Then, add it to the component by creating a `methods` block, using the [ES6 spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax):

```js
methods: {
  ...mapActions(["addToFavorites"])
},
```

::: tip ðŸ’¡
By calling `mapActions` with one parameter, we are defining which actions from our store we want to retrieve. For now we only have `addToFavorites` in this array but in the future we can add more actions as our store grows. You don't always need all actions from your store in one single component. So by passing on this array to `mapActions` we make sure we only get what we need in thhis component. More information can be found [here](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/actions.html#dispatching-actions-in-components).
:::

Now we can dispatch `addToFavorites` like a simple component method.

Let's call this method on the `app-dog` `addToFavorites` event. Edit the `<app-dog` tag in `Pets.vue`:

```html
<app-dog :dog="pet" @addToFavorites="addToFavorites"></app-dog>
```

Try to click on `Add to Favorites` buttons. You can see how the icon badge number increases, open the favorites list by clicking on this icon and check how many dogs we have there.

## Enhance the Logic

For now we can add any dog multiple times but we don't have five Maxes! Let's check our payload inside the `store.js` mutation and add the dog only if it's not in the list already:

```js
addToFavorites(state, payload) {
  if (!state.favorites.includes(payload)) {
      state.favorites.push(payload);
    }
},
```

Here we're first checking if the `payload` element is included in `state.favorites`. We are adding the element only if it's not already in the array.

## Remove from List

Now we need a mechanism to remove dogs from the favorites list. Maybe they were adopted by someone else! Let's create an action and a mutation for this.

In the `store.js` add the `removeFromFavorites` mutation to `mutations` object:

```js
removeFromFavorites(state, payload) {
  state.favorites.splice(state.favorites.indexOf(payload), 1);
}
```

::: tip ðŸ’¡
Here the splice() method changes the contents of an array by removing existing elements. The first argument is the index of the element we want to start with and the second argument is the number of elements we want to remove.
:::

So first we're finding the index of the `payload` item inside the `state.favorites` array and removing the one item starting from this index (i.e. we will remove only the `payload` item itself).

Add the action to commit the `removeFromFavorites` mutation:

```js
removeFromFavorites({ commit }, payload) {
  commit("removeFromFavorites", payload);
}
```

Now we need to dispatch this action when the user clicks the delete icon. Go to the `Favorites.vue` file. As you remember, first we should map actions to component methods. Import `mapActions` helper at the top of the `<script>` tag:

```js
import { mapActions } from 'vuex';
```

and add it to the component `methods` under the `computed` block:

```js
methods: {
  ...mapActions(["removeFromFavorites"])
}
```

And finally add the click listener to the delete icon:

```html
<v-icon @click="removeFromFavorites(dog)">delete</v-icon>
```

Now you can add and remove dogs from your favorites list.

**Whew! Chapter 4 is complete!**
