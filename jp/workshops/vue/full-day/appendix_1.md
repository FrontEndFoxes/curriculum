# ðŸ¤· Appendix 1: Lost? Confused? Starting fresh?

Don't worry! At the beginning of each chapter, you are given a link to start fresh with a new sandbox. Below are instructions on how to create a new sandbox with this Github repo link.

All the chapter links are kept [here](https://github.com/frontendfoxes/projects) - pick your chapter by saving its URL. For example, the downloadable link for Chapter 1 is [https://github.com/frontendfoxes/projects/tree/main/chapter-1-end](https://github.com/frontendfoxes/projects/tree/main/chapter-1-end).
